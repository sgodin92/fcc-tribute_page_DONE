<h3>What is Muay Thai?</h3>
<p id="tribute-info"> Muay Thai is referred to as “The Art of Eight Limbs”; and using eight points of contact the body mimics weapons of war. The hands become the sword and dagger; the shins and forearms were hardened in training to act as armor against blows, and the elbow to fell opponents like a heavy mace or hammer; the legs and knees became the axe and staff. The body operated as one unit. The knees and elbows constantly searching and testing for an opening while grappling and trying to spin an enemy to the ground for the kill.

The King of Thailand is an avid fan of Muay Thai. Since being crowned its popularity has grown more than in any other era in history.</p>
